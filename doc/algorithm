Construction of reps:

Shamgar:  Should we do general or GL3?
S:        Let's do GL2.  Or is it too trivial?

Sh:       It's trivial....  <joke>
	       could do a cartoon

====================================
Question of how to build cuspidals;  (rank n,  i.e. rank 2 for
GL2.. construction is circular... tautological)

Start with GL3

0

1

2

3
==================================
could do 0 and 1 from before;

but do it iteratively:

GL(0):  trivial
